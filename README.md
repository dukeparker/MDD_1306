http://localhost/MDD_1306/SportLines/public/

For my classes, navigate to Sportlines/fuel/app/classes

Fuel keeps my views in fuel/app/views

Not to be confused with the views folder in the classes folder.

Im a bit far behind in this class, I'm still struggling with my API. So I may not have as much to crit as others may.
